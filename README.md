# BakeUp - Backup made easy

BakeUp is a simple backup script for Bachups in Linux.

## Requirements

* GTK 2
* Python (with pygtk)
* Bash

Ubuntu is recommended (especially KDE), but maybe it will also work on other Desktop Environments and Distributions

## Installation

Just run the setup script. Done.
(This will store BakeUp in /opt/bakeup and creates a desktop file in /usr/share/applications)
