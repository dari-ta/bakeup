# BakeUp - Backup made easy

BakeUp is a simple backup script for Bachups in Linux.

## Requirements

* Zenity [zenity]
* GTK 2 [gtk]
* Python (with pygtk) [python, python-gtk2]
* Bash [bash]

Ubuntu is recommended (especially KDE), but maybe it will also work on other Desktop Environments and Distributions

## Installation

Just run the setup script. Done.
(This will store BakeUp in /opt/bakeup and creates a desktop file in /usr/share/applications)
